# E-Commerce Bootcamp

## Purpose
Originally created as a helper tool for instructor-led training, the project aims to become a **comprehensive training codebase** and **publicly available resource**. It offers:
- A more realistic experience for **full-stack developers**.
- Opportunities to work on an application that's **more than simple examples or code snippets**.

This project simulates an **e-shop application** for buyers and sellers. While working on it, imagine you’re a developer who has just joined a partially developed real-world project.

By working on this project, you'll grow your skills in debugging, implementing features.
E.g. as a self-learner

The project uses:
  - **React & Typescript** for the frontend
  - **Spring Boot** for the backend
  - **Keycloak** for OAuth2
  - **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring
  - **Docker** to containerize all components
  - **Jest** for frontend tests
  - **Spring Tests** and **Testcontainers** for integration tests
  - **Koa server** for frontend development mode

### Documentation
- The project is documented using **MkDocs**:
  1. Install MkDocs: `pip install mkdocs`
  2. Navigate to the `documentation` subfolder.
  3. Run: `mkdocs serve` and check the logs for the documentation link.
  4. Check the `overview` section to run the project

- **Alternative:**  
  If you don’t want to install MkDocs
  - Check the `.md` files in the `documentation/docs` folder. 
  - `Begin with overview.md`.

## How to Use

If you attend an **instructor-led training**:
- You'll receive tasks tailored to your level and specific needs.

If you're a **self-learner**:
- If you have **some experience** with React and Spring Boot, check the [extra_tasks.md](documentation/docs/extra_tasks.md) file for relevant tasks.
- If the tasks feel overwhelming, begin with the basics:
    1. **Run the project** successfully.
    2. **Analyze its structure** to understand the components and flow.
    3. Focus on specific areas you want to learn, e.g., how Redux is implemented in the app.

The idea is to use this project as a context for exploring technologies like **TypeScript**, **Jest**, **Redux**, **Spring Data**, etc. 
- Focus on the technologies you need to learn most.
- Once you're familiar with the application's inner workings, deep dive into specific topics:
  - Create **small microprojects** 
  - Use [extra_tasks.md](documentation/docs/extra_tasks.md)
  - Come up with your own exercises (new features, bugfixing exercises, etc.)

Leverage tools like **ChatGPT** to:
- Generate boilerplate code.
- Create your own exercises for debugging and bug fixes.
- Find quick explanations to the code you don't understand.

If you're an **instructor**:
- Use the project to showcase your topics within an app that resembles a **real-life project**.
- If you have advanced learners or "hungry devs" who are far ahead of others, assign them challenges from the [extra_tasks.md](documentation/docs/extra_tasks.md) file to keep them engaged.
